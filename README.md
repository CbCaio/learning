# Learning samples

This repository was created to store all other 'repositories' (folders) that I used while trying to learn a new skill,
basically, these folders started as repositories them later were moved here to better organize my github account.
Feel free to search through the folders and check the code, each folder corresponds to a different topic.

If you are looking for a more concrete code example of my codding style, please check https://github.com/CbCaio/job-tests .
